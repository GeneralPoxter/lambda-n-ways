# Lambda-Calculus cooked **n**-ways

This repository is a simple demonstration of various ways to implement
variable binding in Haskell.

It "benchmarks" several different representations of variable binding and
substitution in the untyped lambda calculus using a single pathological case:
computing the normal form of `factorial 6 == sum [1..37] + 17`. (Spoiler
alert, these terms are not equal, so the normal form is the encoding of
false).

This is derived from Lennart Augustsson's unpublished draft paper
"Lambda-calculus Cooked Four Ways".

## Contents

1. Original four from Lennart Augustsson's paper:

- Simple

  Most direct and traditional implementation based on variable names.
  Renames bound variables to avoid capture.
  
- Unique

  Maintains the invariant that all bound variables are unique. Needs to 
  freshens the binders of terms being substituted to maintain this invariant.
  
- HOAS

  Higher-order abstract synatax (uses Haskell functions for lambda calculus
  functions)

- Debruijn

  DeBruijn indices that shift during substitution.

2. Contributed by Bertram Felgenhauer (not part of benchmark)

- DeBruijnC [DB_C]

  DeBruijn indices without substitutions. Adds a "closure" form to the
  language and uses an environment during normalization.

3. Added by SCW

- DeBruijnParF [DB_F]
  
  Parallel substitution version, representing substitutions as functions. 

- DeBruijnParF [DB_FB]
  
  Parallel substitution version, representing substitutions as functions. 
  Introduces a 'Bind' abstract type to cache substitutions at binders.

- DeBruijnPar [DB_P]

  Parallel substitution version (with reified substs). Based on
  https://github.com/sweirich/challenge/blob/canon/debruijn/debruijn1.md

- DeBruijnParB [DB_B]

  Parallel substitution version with reified substs, but caches a substitution in terms.
  Uses general the purpose library in [Subst](Subst.hs)
  Optimized version described here
  https://github.com/sweirich/challenge/tree/canon/debruijn

- DeBruijnScoped [Scoped]

  Above, but also uses a GADT to enforce that the syntax is well-scoped.

- BoundDB 

  Uses Kmett's [bound](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bound) library.

- Unbound

  Uses the [unbound](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unbound) library
  
- SimpleB

  Optimizes the "simple" approach by caching the substitution and free variable set 
  at binders. Not at all simple. Took a long time to get this one correct.

- Core

  Uses the FV and Substitution functions ripped out of GHC Core (HEAD as of 5/28/20)
  Like DB_C, this file uses a delayed substitution (e.g. environment) during normalization. 
  Does not add any explicit substitutions to the term.
  Uses Data.IntMap instead of lists to keep track of the substitution. 
  
- NominalG

  Uses nominal package & generic programming

## Benchmarks

Download the html files to see the Criterion graphs. Or look at the
[raw results](results/output.txt).
 
1. Normalization of random lambda terms: 
[rand_bench.html](results/rand_bench.html).

These 25 random terms stored in the file [random2.lam](lams/random2.lam).  They are
generated via `genScopedLam` in [Lambda.lhs](lib/Lambda.lhs) with size
parameter `100000`, and so are closed and contain lots of
lambdas. Normalizing these terms requires between 26-36 calls to `subst`. The
terms themselves have total depth from 23-60 and binding depth from 13-46.

2. Conversion to representation: [conv_bench.html](results/conv_bench.html). How long
   does it take to convert a parsed named representation to the internal
   representation of the implementation? alpha-converts the pathological term.
   
3. Normalization of pathological lambda term:
  [nf_bench.html](results/nf_bench.html). See below.

```
   bind depth: 25
   depth:      53
   num substs: 119697
```

4. Alpha-equivalence of pathological lambda term:
   [aeq_bench.html](results/aeq_bench.html)
   

### Normalization microbenchmark

The microbenchmark is full normalization of the lambda-calculus
term: `factorial 6 == sum [1..37] + 17` represented with a Scott-encoding of
the datatypes. See [lennart.lam](lams/lennart.lam) for the definition of this term.

By full normalization, we mean computing the following partial function that 
repeatedly performs beta-reduction on the leftmost redex.

      nf x         = x
      nf (\x.e)    = \x. nf e
      nf (e1 e2)   = nf ({e2/x}e1')         when whnf e1 = \x.e1'
                    (nf (whnf e1)) (nf e2)       otherwise

      whnf x       = x
      whnf (\x.e)  = \x.e
      whnf (e1 e2) = whnf ({e2/x} e1') when whnf e1 = \x.e1'
                    (whnf e1) e2            otherwise

Note: the goal of this operation is to benchmark the *substitution* function,
written above as {e2/x}e1.  As a result, even though some lambda calulus
implementations may support more efficient ways of computing the normal form
of a term (i.e. by normalizing e2 at most once) we are not interested in
enabling that computation. Instead, we want the computation to be as close to the 
implementation above as possible.

Because this function is partial (not all lambda-calculus terms have normal
forms), for testing, each implementation also should support a "fueled"
version of the `nf` and `whnf` functions (called `nfi` and `whnfi`,
respectively). However, benchmarking uses the unfueled version.

## Running the benchmarks

     make timing

## Testing the benchmarks

Unit tests:
- Verifies that each implementation correctly normalizes the pathological term.
- Verifies that each implementation correctly normalizes the random lambda terms
      random.lam -> random.nf2.lam

QC:
- conversion from/to named representation is identity on lambda terms
- freshened version of random lambda term is AEQ
- nf on random lambda term matches reference version (DB)
   (This test is only for impls with a "fueled version" of normalization)

     stack test
